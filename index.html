                        <p class="card-text">Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was a renowned Indian scientist and the 11th President
                            of India. He made significant
                            contributions to India's space and defense programs and was known as the "People's
                            President."</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">He was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and passed
                            away on July 27, 2015. Dr. Kalam's life
                            and work continue to inspire millions around the world.</p>
                        <p>Due to his style of working and interaction with common people, especially the youth, he was
                            affectionately
                            called as Peoples President. According to Dr. Kalam, the most arduous decision he had taken
                            during his
                            tenure was that of signing the Office of Profit Bill.

                            During his tenure as President, he faced criticism for his inaction in deciding the fate of
                            mercy petitions that
                            were submitted to him. Out of the 21 mercy petitions, he acted only on one mercy plea. In
                            2005, he recommended
                            for President's rule in Bihar, which also became a controversial decision.
